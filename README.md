Game I made as an entry for the Pixel Game Jam 2024. This is the first game I have ever coded. I used Pygame and Aseprite. It is a fishing game, with a little fisherman and a few different animated fishes. 
You click to fish and for every fish caught you get a certain number of points. If you however catch the evil fish you lose 30 points. To win you need 500 points. 
I wrote my own code and I drew the pixel art but I used the sources below for the sounds and the fonts.

I got the sounds from this website <a href = "https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> and I got the fonts from <a href = "https://www.fontspace.com/category/pixel"> Fontspace </a>. 
Specifically I used the 'Minecraft Font' by JDGraphics <a href = "https://www.fontspace.com/minecraft-font-f28180" >Minecraft Font </a> 
and 'Super Pixel Font' by All Super Font <a href = "https://www.fontspace.com/super-pixel-font-f112028" > Super Pixel Font </a>. I used the Super Pixel Font for my menu mainly and I used the Minecraft Font for the in game and how to text.
